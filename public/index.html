        <h3>Nathan Cashman</h3>
        <p>I'm an ex-music educator with a bachelor's degree from Drake University. After choosing to leave the field of education, I decided to follow an interest in technology I've had since a young age. My interest in the field was inspired by the numerous innovations that constantly emerge from the field of technology and I decided I'd like to be a part of that. Through my past experiences in education and music, I am proficient in higher-level thinking and professional communication and I have developed a strong work ethic and sense of self-motivation. In my current field, I am well rounded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and I am adept at thinking through a given problem and figuring out the most effective way to solve it. My goal is simply to find a role in an industry where I can make use of my love of learning.
        Responsibilities on this project: </p>

        <h3>Marc Hauschildt</h3>
        <p>My name is <a href="https://github.com/mlhaus" target="_blank">Marc</a>. I graduated from the University of Northern Iowa in 2003 with a degree in Business teaching. Since 2004 he has been a high school business and computer science teacher at West Liberty High School. I am participating in the DeltaV Code School for professional development. I plan to take concepts learned back to the classes I teach and in personal projects. During the past month I have learned about responsive design, AJAX/JSON and asynchronous programming, functional programming, client-side routing, single-page app development, SQL, relational data, MVC, middleware, APIs and deployment using Heroku.</p>

        <img src="/images/Capture.PNG" alt="Facewall Logo by Craig" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        <P>With a Management Information Systems Degree, I have worked with medium retail businesses for the last 15 years and enjoy using my knowledge to create value for those companies. I am currently a DeltaV student, as well as a Kirkwood Community College student finishing a Computer Software Development and Web Technologies Associate in Applied Science. I am effective at learning and integrating those new technology skills into my development process. I am hoping to find a role creating world class business applications for small to medium size businesses. As a small business owner I know the importance of having a strategic business plan that includes a technology as a main component to their success; and I want to share my management skills and experiences with them to help them overcome the boundaries that all businesses face in the global market..</P>
